#First Blog#
> Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest. How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.--**Proverbs 6:6-11**

I start to write blog ***again***! Just because of my laziness, the times that I began to write a blog is almost as much as the times I annouced to lose weight.

Since I start to write is again, unless at the moment I have the confindence to make it a good place to keep my notes of knowledge, my guitar tabs, my feelings about life and so on.

I'll publish it now, and maybe update it later, see you~
